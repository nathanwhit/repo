#Springfinity
A remake of Infiniboard by chpwn for iOS 11 and 12.
Supports all devices iOS 11-12.1.2, including A12 devices and iPads.
Contains all of the features of the original Infiniboard plus additional options.

If your device is not A12 you can _optionally_ install IconSupport from BigBoss, which saves your icon layout if you
uninstall/reinstall Springfinity. Otherwise, Springfinity functions identically without IconSupport.

##Known Issues
For a short time (a couple seconds) after dropping icons, they're temporarily able to visually pass over the dock. This is due to how Apple has implemented drag-and-drop behavior, and while I'm looking into it I'm not sure it's practical to fix.
