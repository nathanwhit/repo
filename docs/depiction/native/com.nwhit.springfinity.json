Otherwise, Springfinity functions identically without IconSupport.\n\n##Known Issues\nFor a short time (a couple seconds) after dropping icons, they're temporarily able to visually pass over the dock. This is due to how Apple has implemented drag-and-drop behavior, and while I'm looking into it I'm not sure it's practical to fix.\n\n##Support\nTwitter : @NathanWDev\n\nEmail : nathan.whitaker01@gmail.com\n\nReddit : u/ibeforeyou\n\nContributions are welcomed, and can go to\n[my PayPal account](https://paypal.me/NathanWDev)\n\n\n##Credits\nCredits to chpwn/Xuzz Productions for Infiniboard, which this tweak was built off of.", "useSpacing": "true", "class": "DepictionMarkdownView"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionHeaderView", "title": "Information"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Developer", "text": "Nathan Whitaker"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Version", "text": "1.1"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Compatibility", "text": "iOS 11.0 to 12.1.2"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Section", "text": "Tweaks"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionTableButtonView", "title": "View Source Code", "action": "https://github.com/nathanwhit/Springfinity", "openExternal": "true", "tintColor": "#35007a"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionTableButtonView", "title": "Contact Support", "action": "depiction-https:///depiction/native/help/com.nwhit.springfinity.json", "openExternal": "true", "tintColor": "#35007a"}, {"class": "DepictionLabelView", "text": "Silica 1.0.0 \u2013 Updated 2019-05-12", "textColor": "#999999", "fontSize": "10.0", "alignment": 1}], "class": "DepictionStackView"}, {"tabname": "Changelog", "views": [{"class": "DepictionMarkdownView", "markdown": "#### Version 1.0\n\nInitial release of Springfinity"}, {"class": "DepictionLabelView", "text": "Silica 1.0.0 \u2013 Updated 2019-05-12", "textColor": "#999999", "fontSize": "10.0", "alignment": 1}], "class": "DepictionStackView"}], "class": "DepictionTabView"}
